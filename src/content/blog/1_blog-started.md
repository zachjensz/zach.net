description: First post after starting a fork of AstroPaper for my blog
---

This is my first post after starting a fork of AstroPaper for my blog! I intend to write a bunch of articles on Linux, especially daily driving it as a desktop like I do. Expect to see articles on free keyboard centric software that lets you do common stuff quickly. I hope to write about webdev as well as its a career path that interests me and I love making interactive web games and apps. I might also talk about other hobbies or everyday life, anything that interests me.
Stay tuned for future posts!
