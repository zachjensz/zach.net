ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Zach

I live in Melbourne, Australia.
You'll find me developing websites on my Linux desktop, flying small planes, going on long bike rides or chilling by a fire in the garden.

This blog is a place to share anything that interests me or is on my mind, make use of the tags to narrow down what interests you!
